# FileFolder
A simple script to create a folder for every file in a directory and then move the file in the new folder.

## Why?
Yes. Great question. The reason why I made this is kinda strange, but you've probably found yourself here too sometimes. \
Basically, I just had a folder with many big files, and Windows explorer took *wayyyy too much* to load it.

And I thought to myself: "*What if I had a folder for every file? Would it still take a lot? Oh, I wish there was a software to do exactly that" :/*\
Then  remembered: **I AM A CODER! I COULD DO THAT!**\
So I got to work, and in about 3-4 hours, i had a script that worked exactly how i wanted.

## Requirements
None! Only Python ~obviously, duh~, as this uses python builtins
### Note
> This was tested and developd using python 3.10, and i do not know if it works with previous versions. I will update this readme if i know it works with other version, but will not be testing versions myself, as it would take *too long*, ~sorry~.

## Why can't i call it from another module?
There really is no reason for it. I just don't see how it could be used from another module, and i didn't need to use it in other programs in the first place. If you need to use it for whatever reason, you can just edit out the code at end :)

## I found a bug, what do i do?
If you found a bug you can either choose to fix it yourself, or create an issue and i will try and look into it
> PS: if you manage to fix it by yourself, please create a PR explaining the bug and the related fix, it would be really appreciated!
